OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision Library) is Python library to solve computer vision related problems. Objects are detected in OpenCV  with the help of haarcascade classifiers.
Haar cascade. Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video.
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. 

1. Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify. 
2. Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect

Main Objective here is to detect the vehicle moving on the road using openCV object detection method.
